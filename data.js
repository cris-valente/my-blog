          "value": "How I got started\n\nChingu Voyages are 6-week long remote team projects where designed to help students put technical knowledge they've gained into practice as well as improve skills like teamwork, collaboration, and project management.\n\nTo embark on a Chingu voyage first we need to complete a solo project. I did HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a trivia. The only thing set were the questions. I wrote the code on VSCode, pushed it to Github using Github desktop, and wrote a comprehensive 'Read Me' file.\n\n"

Out of the friendly Scrimba platform, I had to figure out why my 'console.log' would not work, and testing got complicated.\n\nI also struggled with a CSS and JS animation. I wanted questions to disappear to the left and arrive from the right. I don't know if this is the right way, but I just made it disappear to the left, stay hidden, and transition all the way to the right and then come back to the center. In the end, my fingers were sweating and there was smoke coming out of my keyboard...\n\n"

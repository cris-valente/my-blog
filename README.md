# My Learning journal

## Overview

This website has been created as a solo project in the purpose of learning more about CSS properties that make a website resposive like media queries and grid.

## Features
The website contains two html pages (home and about) linked in the nav bar.  
The website is responsive and if it's viewed in a large screen all the articles take the space available to form a grid.
It has a viewmore button that hides or shows articles.

## Next steps
It would be nice to find a way to render all articles using a JSON file to store all data and accessing it to render featured article. And also render a different page with each article and its content.

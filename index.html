                    <p><b>How I stay committed to learning</b><br><br>

                    I always liked to learn things by myself and while learning to play guittar in high school and learning to surfing and standing by myself in the middle of the raging waves, learning to code alone can be even more chalenging and sometimes very frustrating.<br><br>

                    While Scrimba courses are fun and very helpful, I felt like it would be also interesting to code together with other students that come different backgrounds and have different skills.<br><br>

                    <b>How I got started</b><br><br>
                    
                    Chingu Voyages are 6-week long remote team projects where designed to help students put technical knowledge they've gained into practice as well as improve skills like teamwork, collaboration, and project management.<br><br>

                    To embark in a Chingu voyage first we need to complete a solo project. I did HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a trivia. The only thing set were the questions. I wrote the code on VSCode, pushed it to Github using Github desktop and wrote a comprehensive 'Read Me' file.<br><br>
                    
                    <img id="trivia-img" 
                    src="images/1st-question-trivia.png" 
                    alt="A laptop on a desktop at sunset">

                    That helped me get a bit more familiar with the real workflow, out of friendly Scrimba platform I had to figure out why my 'console.log' would not work and testing got complicated.<br><br> 
                    
                    I also struggled with an CSS and JS animation. I wanted questions to disappear to the left and arrive from the right. I don't if this is the right way but I just made it disappear to the left, stay hidden and transition all the way to the right and then come back to the center. In the end my fingers were swetting and there was smoke coming out of my keyboard... <br><br>
